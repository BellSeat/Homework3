# HW 3 STATE MANAGEMENT
## 1.The various states that an app can enter on your platform of choice  
When the user or system requests a new scene for our app, UIKit creates it and puts it in the unattached state. User-requested scenes, for example battle game scene, move quickly to the foreground, where they appear onscreen. A system-requested scene typically moves to the background so that it can process an event. For example, the system might launch the scene in the background to process a location event. When the user dismisses your appâ€™s UI, UIKit moves the associated scene to the background state and eventually to the suspended state. UIKit can disconnect a background or suspended scene at any time to reclaim its resources, returning that scene to the unattached state.

As a game program, there are also some extent states: 
+ applicationDidBecomeActive: - Restart any tasks paused (or not yet started) while inactive.
+ applicationWillResignActive: - Pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and throttle down frame rates. Games should pause here.
+ applicationDidEnterBackground: - Save application data, invalidate timers, and store enough application state information to restore your application to its current state in case it is terminated later.
+ applicationWillEnterForeground: - Undo any changes you made in entering the background.


## 2.The various states that you must consider for your app, why you must consider it, and what must happen in each state.

1. Foreground Active State: in this state, iOS would configure user UI and prepare to interact with user. The user profile and usersetting should be currect download and rendering in app. If there is not network or inaccurate user data, foreground should presnt error message till every data prepared

2. Foreground Inactive: There are two ways to turning into foreground inactive, from unattached and from froground active. Even in diagram, first type forground inactive look like parallel to background state but it still waiting the response from background. If foreground active move into forground inactive, our game should suddenly update user current data to server with `.onDisappear`, and when user awake our game, the `.onAppear` will compare user local user setting data with server-side user data. If same, do nothing, else down user data. "Server first rule"
